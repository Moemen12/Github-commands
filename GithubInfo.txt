cd .. :to back one dir to behind
rmdir "dirName" : to remove the directory

  to make a folder :  mkdir  'folder/dir name'  then press enter
  to open folder : cd folderName/                    => slash to open the folder
  to clone a github repository :  git clone 'repoLink'

  to add a file for tracking: git add 'fileName'
  to remove file before commit it : git reset head 'fileName'
  status : git status
  to commit : git commit -m" description"

  all thing now, where? its is on my local repo and we must to push it to remote repo
   
  get my remote repo : git remote -v 
  get branches : git branch

  to push allthing to remote repo : git push 'remote repoName' 'remoteBranch'
  to take the new editors(file..) that the team did it :git pull 'remoteRepoName'
  
  configuration list :git config -l

  git config --global 'value= what about i am searching for' example  git config --global user.email

 How can i create a public key?
  what is a public key:
  A private key that is stored only on your computer. If the keys match, you're granted access.
  ssh : secure shell
  keygen:key generator : it generate a key
 -t type of algorithm that i want to create the key by it
 rsa (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman):  is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission
 -b : number of bits

 step 1 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my email"
then i must to add a password and confirm it

output:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/moemensaadeh/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/moemensaadeh/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


i want the ssh key that it is the public key content. how?
step 2  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub then press enter to see ssh key ,copy and paste it to ssh keys at settings in github 

!! to see if all thing worked correctly
ssh -T git@github.com



About alias:
------------
how can i edit the config to be more simply 
git config --global alias.st status   : it will be "git st "

edit anything by code : git config --global --edit


create a branch
--------------
git branch "name"
we can chech if the branch created by "git branch"
after writing git branch , if the branch name color is green ,in this case i am in this branch now
And if i want change it to another branch ,we can like this 
git checkout "name of the new branch that i want switch to it"

delete a branch
-------------
git branch -d "name of branch that i want to delete it"


create a branch and switch to it in the same time:
----------------------------------------------------
git checkout -b "name of the new branch that i want to create and switch to it "


Rename a branch:
-----------------
git branch -m "the new name of branch"

merge 2 branch
------------
git merge "branch name that i want to branch it with other branch"
after merging it we can delete the second file




if i want to store files without remove it before commit : git stash
if i want to call it : git stash pop
if you we want to see the list of stash : git stash list
and if we want save it as name : git stash list save "name"
git stash pop stash@{number of index} : it will call the file by the index
git stash show stash@{number of index} : it will call file name by index

write something in file isnt exist (create file and add to it) like this:
echo "what do i want to write in it" > filename.type of file


git stash apply: take the last file that i maked it to stashing and if we did " git stash list" it will stay in the list but
if we did git stash pop it willn't stay in the stash list

git stash drop : it will delete the last file 
git stash drop stash@{number of index} : it will delete the file by the index


git stash clear : it will delete all stash files


restore:
git restore --staged "fileName"



git clean :  git clean -n
that if we want to remove all untracked files :git clean -f
--------------------------------------------

if we want to leave some file without removing it :
git clean -n
git add "file that i don't want to delete it"
git clean -n
git clean -f




if i want to delete a created commmit and if this commit is the head how?
fisrt how can i know which commit is the head?
by this command : git log 

all commit has a hash like this:

commit 34rr4f1rsad9d72137156ce55Dc63d2b22b766u(HEAD -> main)
Author: Moemen <moemensaadeh3@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 17 10:02:33 2012 +0300

    main.php

    And if we want to delete this commit:
    git reset --hard "hash code for the commit that i want to make it in head"
then git push 'remote repoName' 'remoteBranch' --force

-----------------------------------
ls -a : to show the files and folder



if i want to ignore files and directories through the extension of file :
code .git ignore ,then wait a few seconds , the editor(visual studio) will open then write this 
*.txt : all txt documents willn't appear if we did git status

!if we have a file from all file with txt extension and we want it ,we must write in editor:
!fileName.txt   : fileName that i dont want to ignore it 



asking about tag:
---------------
git tag

create a tag:
-------------
git tag "tag name"   
github advice programmers to give the tag names like this " V1.0"

then we must push it to remote repo:
git push origin main "file name" -m "description"



how can i do a list for my tag
git tag -l "v1.*"



to delete the release or the tag "from github settings"

and if i want to delete it by command line from local repo (locally)
git tag -d "tag name"


and if i want to delete it by command line from remote repo but it will stay in local repo (remotly)
git push origin --delete "fileName"
